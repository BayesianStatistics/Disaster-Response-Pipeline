# Disaster-Response-Project
This is part of the project requirements of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree and it consists of the second part of this course (Software Engineering-Software Development-Data Engineering part) mainly focused on a web app development of NLP machine learning model for a real use case scenario of [Figure Eight](https://appen.com/).

## Project Goal
The main aim of this project is to classify disaster text messages into different categories. During this project, I share a detailed data analysis in order to construct an intelligent machine learning model that is deployed in a web app interface and allows to classify disaster messages. Based on these, the user can type as input a new disaster message and associated with the classification results of the corresponding categories. In addition, the web app interface also displays additional visualizations of this data analysis.
